#
# Moloch uses a tiered system for configuration variables.  This allows Moloch
# to share one config file for many machines.  The ordering of sections in this
# file doesn't matter.
#
# Order of config variables:
# 1st) [optional] The section titled with the node name is used first.
# 2nd) [optional] If a node has a nodeClass variable, the section titled with
#      the nodeClass name is used next.  Sessions will be tagged with
#      class:<node class name> which may be useful if watching different networks.
# 3rd) The section titled "default" is used last.

# Headers to use to determine if user from `userNameHeader` is
# authorized to use the system, and if so create a new user
# in the Moloch user database.  This implementation expects that
# the users LDAP/AD groups (or similar) are populated into an
# HTTP header by the Apache (or similar) referenced above.
# The JSON in userAutoCreateTmpl is used to insert the new
# user into the moloch database (if not already present)
# and additional HTTP headers can be sourced from the request
# to populate various fields.
#
# The example below pulls verifies that an HTTP header called `UserGroup`
# is present, and contains the value "MOLOCH_ACCESS".  If this authorization
# check passes, the user database is inspected for the user in `userNameHeader`
# and if it is not present it is created.  The system uses the
# `moloch_user` and `http_auth_mail` headers from the
# request and uses them to populate `userId` and `userName`
# fields for the new user record.
#
# Once the user record is created, this functionaity
# neither updates nor deletes the data, though if the user is no longer
# reported to be in the group, access is denied regardless of the status
# in the moloch database.
